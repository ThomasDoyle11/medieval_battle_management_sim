# Medieval Battle Management Simulator

This is a selection of files and tools used in the construction of a game tentatively named '**Medieval Battle Management Simulator**', in which the player takes control of a _Squadron_ of _Knights_, and does _Battle_ with other _Squadrons_ within an organised _Competition_.

**The files showcase** my knowledge of object-oriented programming and some creativity (I hope).

As this is just an excerpt there will be references to many files I haven't included, and some files will be older versions that may contain errors (purposeful of course, for the reader) however if you have any queries I will be happy to answer them via my email provided on my [Portfolio](https://thomasdoyle11.github.io/).
