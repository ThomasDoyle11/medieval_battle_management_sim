# Sigil Generator

The 'Sigil Generator' tool is used to generate a 'Sigil' for an entity.

That entity could be (with real-life equivalent examples):

- A House (such as the historic House of York)
- A Competition (such as the English Premier League)
- A Region (such as Derbyshire)
- A Squadron (such as Manchester United FC)

In this area, you will find:
- The 'classes' folder, which contains a collection of C# scripts used to render the Sigils in Unity
- The 'data_generator' folder, which contains a collection of Python scripts used to generate JSON files which define Sigils.
